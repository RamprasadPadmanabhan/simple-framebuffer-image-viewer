About this image viewer

image is a very small image viewer which uses Imlib2 library
from Enlightment project. It was inspired by many wonderful
softwares which use framebuffer to display images and work
great in a simple text console based Linux systems like w3m.

Installation procedure

After extracting the contents, go into the directory.

Type make to compile

Then type make install with superuser privileges
                       to install the executable
Then type make install.man with superuser privileges
                       to install the manual page

The image command is then ready to go. 

For bug fixes please send a mail to <rpprasadp@gmail.com>

I took lot of help from w3m project by Akinori Ito to know how
to use Imlib2. I also learnt the use of framebuffer from a simple
framebuffer based project by Fred Eckert in github
https://gist.github.com/FredEckert/3425429. I also learnt the beauty
of small softwares from Heliwm project by Hidetoshi Ohtomo.
